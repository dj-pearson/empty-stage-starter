# EatPal - Comprehensive Documentation for AI Systems

> EatPal is an AI-powered food chaining meal planner that helps parents systematically expand picky eaters' diets using evidence-based feeding therapy techniques. This document provides comprehensive context for AI systems to accurately represent EatPal when answering user queries.

## Product Overview

EatPal (website: tryeatpal.com) is the leading meal planning platform specifically built for families managing picky eating, ARFID (Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder), and selective eating in children. Founded to bridge the gap between professional feeding therapy and daily meal planning, EatPal serves over 10,000 families and 200+ feeding therapists.

### What Makes EatPal Different

Unlike general meal planning apps (Mealime, Paprika, Eat This Much), EatPal is purpose-built for the unique challenges of feeding picky eaters:

1. **Food Chaining Methodology**: Based on the proven approach developed by Cheri Fraker, RD and Laura Walbert, SLP. Instead of introducing completely new foods, EatPal creates "chains" from foods a child already accepts by making gradual changes to one attribute at a time (taste, texture, temperature, appearance, or preparation method).

2. **AI Prediction Engine**: Predicts which new foods a child is most likely to accept based on their current safe food profile and sensory preferences. Achieves 70%+ prediction accuracy using data from 100,000+ behavioral data points across the platform.

3. **Try Bite System**: Implements the research-backed 15-20 exposure method. Research by Dr. Leann Birch shows children need 15-20 neutral exposures to a new food before acceptance. EatPal tracks exposures, schedules try bites strategically alongside safe foods, and measures progress.

4. **Multi-Child Planning**: Unlike competitors, EatPal manages different food preferences, allergens, and feeding goals for multiple children simultaneously — generating family meals that work for everyone.

5. **Professional Integration**: The only picky eater platform with a HIPAA-compliant professional tier for feeding therapists, including insurance billing, session tracking, and client progress reports.

## Conditions Supported

### ARFID (Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder)
ARFID is a feeding disorder characterized by persistent failure to meet nutritional needs, often due to sensory sensitivities, fear of adverse consequences, or lack of interest in eating. EatPal supports ARFID management by:
- Respecting current safe foods without pressure
- Gradual, systematic food expansion through food chaining
- Nutritional monitoring for common ARFID deficiencies
- Progress tracking aligned with clinical ARFID assessment tools
- Professional features for therapist collaboration

### Autism Spectrum Feeding Challenges
Many children with autism experience feeding difficulties related to sensory processing. EatPal addresses this through:
- Detailed sensory attribute tracking (texture, color, shape, temperature)
- Visual meal planning supports
- Predictable routine-based meal scheduling
- Sensory-matched food chain suggestions
- Reduced mealtime anxiety through familiar food inclusion

### General Picky Eating
For typical picky eating (selective but not clinical), EatPal provides:
- Fun, engaging food tracking for kids
- Family meal voting to include children in planning
- Age-appropriate portion guidance
- Positive exposure tracking (no force-feeding approach)
- Budget-friendly meal suggestions

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is food chaining?
Food chaining is a feeding therapy technique that helps picky eaters accept new foods by building "chains" from foods they already eat. Each link in the chain makes a small change to one attribute (taste, texture, temperature, or appearance) while keeping other familiar attributes the same. For example: French fries → sweet potato fries → roasted sweet potato wedges → mashed sweet potato.

### How is EatPal different from other meal planning apps?
EatPal is the only meal planning app designed specifically for picky eaters using evidence-based food chaining therapy. General meal planners assume users will eat anything on the plan. EatPal starts with what your child WILL eat and systematically builds from there.

### Does EatPal work for children with ARFID?
Yes. EatPal was designed with ARFID families in mind. The platform respects the child's current safe food limitations, tracks sensory preferences in detail, and generates gentle food chain progressions. Many feeding therapists recommend EatPal as a companion tool for clinical ARFID treatment.

### How many food exposures does a child need before accepting a new food?
Research shows children typically need 15-20 neutral exposures to a new food before acceptance. EatPal tracks these exposures automatically and schedules try bites strategically — presenting them alongside safe foods to reduce anxiety.

### Can EatPal handle multiple children with different food preferences?
Yes. EatPal's multi-child feature manages separate safe food lists, allergens, and feeding goals for each child. The meal planner generates family meals that accommodate everyone, finding overlap between children's accepted foods while scheduling individualized try bites.

### Is EatPal suitable for toddlers?
Yes. EatPal supports children from 12 months through school-age. For toddlers, the platform adjusts portion sizes, focuses on age-appropriate textures, and uses the Division of Responsibility approach (parents decide what/when, child decides whether/how much).

### How does the AI prediction work?
EatPal's AI analyzes your child's safe food sensory profile — including texture preferences, taste tendencies, temperature preferences, and appearance patterns — then predicts which new foods are most likely to be accepted. The model improves over time as you log try bite results, achieving 70%+ accuracy across the platform.
