## Methodology
EatPal's food chaining approach works by making small, systematic changes to foods a child already accepts. For example, if a child eats chicken nuggets, the platform generates a chain: chicken nuggets -> breaded chicken strips -> baked chicken tenders -> plain grilled chicken pieces. Each step changes only one attribute (shape, coating, preparation method) while keeping familiar elements. Research shows this method achieves a 40% average increase in accepted foods when followed consistently.
