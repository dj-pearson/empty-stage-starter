1. Positioning & Niche: What EatPal Is (and Who It’s For)
From your public snippets:

“AI-powered meal planning platform for families with picky eaters, ARFID, and selective eating challenges.”

“Our platform uses food chaining science to help children expand their food acceptance.”

Meta blurbs mention “The Operating System for Feeding Therapy”, “70%+ AI prediction accuracy, 200+ therapists, 100K+ behavioral data points, insurance integration.”

You’re sitting at the intersection of:

Parents/families with extreme picky eating or ARFID

Feeding therapists/clinics who want structured tools and data

The niche itself is strong:

ARFID and severe feeding disorders are increasingly recognized; estimates suggest ARFID may affect 0.3–3% of the general population and up to 18% of children/adolescents in some samples.

In pediatric inpatient eating disorder programs, ARFID accounts for 5–14% of cases.
​

Around 20% of children in the US struggle with severe feeding disorders, per CHOA case study of their intensive feeding program.
​

Food chaining is accepted as an evidence-based therapeutic strategy and is widely used by pediatric feeding specialists.

There are adjacent players (BetterBites/Kids Eat in Color app, online courses, ARFID meal-planning content, etc.), but there is still no obvious market-dominant “OS for feeding therapy + parent-facing app” that marries food-chaining science with AI and structured data.

This is a very defensible niche with:

High pain (daily family stress, medical risk)

Willingness to pay (courses, therapy, specialized programs)

Structural distribution (pediatricians, therapists, clinics as referral hubs)

Clinical evidence backing your core method (food chaining)

Your key strategic decision:

Make the homepage primarily parent-facing, framed as “built with and used by feeding therapists”, with a clear secondary path for professionals.

This maximizes conversion on cold traffic (parents) while preserving your B2B story (“The Operating System for Feeding Therapy”).

2. A Realistic Path to $15k MRR
Without your exact pricing, here’s a concrete structure you can adjust:

Hypothesis: Hybrid B2C + B2B
Parents plan (B2C)

Price: 25–35 USD/month, monthly; 249–299/year annual plan (discount)

Goal: 400–500 active paying families → ~12k–15k MRR

Therapist/clinic plan (B2B)

Price: 99–249 USD/month per clinician seat, or per-clinic tiers

Goal: 20–30 active therapist accounts → 2k–5k MRR

Combined, that’s a credible route to 15k+ MRR with:

A few hundred high-intent parents (a realistic number given SEO + therapist referrals)

A relatively small but high-value therapist base

Your messaging and site architecture should therefore:

Convert high-anxiety parents who search for “ARFID meal plan”, “food chaining for picky eater”, etc.

Use therapist adoption as both validation and distribution (they refer families into EatPal).

3. Homepage Messaging: Concrete Copy & Structure
Below is a page structure and copy you can drop straight into your React app and refine.

3.1 Hero Section (Above the Fold)
Goal: Answer “What is this? Is it for me? Does it actually help?” within 3 seconds.

Headline options (pick one and test):

“Turn mealtime battles into steady progress, one safe bite at a time.”

“An evidence-based meal planner for extreme picky eating and ARFID.”

“Food chaining, made practical for real families.”

Subhead example:

EatPal is an AI-powered meal planning app built on food chaining science to help families with extreme picky eating, ARFID, and autism-related feeding challenges. Created alongside feeding therapists and backed by 100K+ real mealtime data points.

Primary CTA (parents):

Button: “Get your personalized 5-day plan”
Small note under button: “Takes 2 minutes. Tailored to your child’s safe foods.”

Secondary CTA (therapists):

Text link: “For feeding therapists →” leading to a dedicated /therapists page (or section anchor).

3.2 Social Proof / Trust Strip
Directly under the hero:

“Built with and used by 200+ feeding therapists and dietitians.”

“Grounded in food chaining, a research-backed approach used worldwide to expand kids’ diets.”

Short logos if you have them (institutions, podcasts, or “As seen in…”)

If you do not yet have large logos, lean into credential types:

“Used in outpatient feeding clinics, private practices, and by families at home.”

3.3 Problem → Outcome Section
Section title: “Why typical meal planning apps fail for ARFID and extreme picky eating”

Bullets:

“Standard meal apps assume kids will ‘just try it’ – ARFID and severe picky eating don’t work that way.”

“Parents are told to ‘offer variety’ without a safe plan, which often increases anxiety and refusals.”

“Feeding therapy sessions are powerful, but progress can stall without structured support at home.”
​

Then flip to solution:

Mini-headline: “EatPal is built specifically for feeding disorders”

“Uses food chaining to bridge from your child’s ‘safe foods’ to new foods in tiny, manageable steps.”

“Plans meals around your child’s sensory preferences and fear triggers, not generic recipes.”

“Keeps parents and therapists aligned with shared goals and progress tracking.”

3.4 Three-Pillar Value Proposition
Use three simple cards:

Evidence-based progress, not guesswork

AI suggestions grounded in food chaining principles and therapist-designed rules.

Detects patterns (textures, brands, flavors) that your child actually accepts.

Calmer, safer-feeling mealtimes

Scripts and prompts for what to say (and what not to say) at the table.

Visual progress charts to help kids see their own wins.

Designed with feeding therapists

Supports food logs, safe-food lists, and chain design that match clinic workflows.

Optional therapist portal so your care team sees the same data you do.

3.5 “How EatPal Works” Flow
Three steps, each with an illustrative icon:

Tell us your child’s story

Age, diagnosis/suspicions (ARFID, autism, sensory), safe foods, red-flag foods, textures they avoid.

Get a 5-day tailored plan

AI generates a plan using food chaining – micro-changes from safe foods to similar new foods.

Includes grocery list and backup options for tough days.
​

Track, adjust, and celebrate

Log what was tried, what was refused, and your child’s stress level.

EatPal adjusts the next chains and shows progress over weeks.

CTA after this section: “Start your first 5 days free” or “Try EatPal free for 14 days”.

3.6 Therapist / Clinic Section on Homepage
Even without a full separate page, add a section:

Mini-headline: “The operating system for feeding therapy”

Copy:

EatPal gives feeding clinics and private practices a shared, data-rich workspace to extend therapy into the home. Replace manual spreadsheets and paper logs with AI-assisted food chains, session notes, and real-world mealtime data.
​

Bullets:

“Create and share individualized food chains with families.”

“Capture real-time meal logs and photos between sessions.”

“Standardize data collection across therapists and locations.”
​

CTA: “See therapist plans →” leading to pricing.

4. Brand Identity & Voice
4.1 Core Brand Story
You want to show that:

You understand how terrifying feeding difficulties feel for parents.

You are aligned with clinical best practice, not a random app.

You offer tiny, doable steps that fit into real life.

A simple narrative you can echo:

“EatPal exists so families dealing with extreme picky eating and ARFID don’t have to choose between overwhelming therapy protocols and doing nothing. By turning food chaining into a practical, day-to-day meal planner, we help children safely discover new foods while keeping mealtimes as calm as possible.”

4.2 Voice & Tone Guidelines
Calm, grounded, and hopeful – avoid hype or miracle claims.

Plain-language clinical – explain terms like ARFID and food chaining once, then use them confidently.

Parent-first framing – speak directly to “you” (the caregiver) with high empathy.

Non-blaming – clearly state it’s not the parent’s fault and not just “picky eating”.

Sample tonal shift:

Instead of: “Eliminate picky eating forever.”
Use: “Reduce mealtime battles and expand your child’s diet at a pace that feels safe for them – and you.”

5. Color & Visual Direction
Since the actual palette isn’t accessible from here, this is principle-based advice plus concrete schemes.

5.1 What Often Goes Wrong with “Bold” Palettes
In a niche where users are:

Exhausted, anxious parents

Working through a medical/behavioral condition

Overly bold choices can backfire:

Highly saturated reds/oranges as large backgrounds can feel alarming or urgent (emergency signal).

Neon accents everywhere can feel chaotic when the user is seeking calm and control.

Too many strong colors in the same view can distract from the core message and decrease perceived credibility.

5.2 Principles for Your Niche
You want a balance of:

Healthcare trust → blues/teals, soft greens

Warmth and humanity → gentle peaches, soft corals, muted yellows

Child-friendly without being “kiddy” → avoid babyish primary colors everywhere; instead use them sparingly as accents.

Visual goals:

Backgrounds: mostly off-white or very light tints to keep things bright and breathable.

Primary brand color: one main hue (e.g., teal) for buttons and key highlights.

Secondary/tertiary: 1–2 supporting accent colors for charts, badges, illustrations.

5.3 Two Concrete Palette Options
You can adapt these to Tailwind tokens or your design system.

Option A – Calm Clinical + Warm Accent

Primary: Teal 600 – #008C8C (buttons, links, key highlights)

Primary light: Teal 50 – #E6FAF7 (light sections, cards)

Neutral dark (text): Slate 900 – #0F172A

Neutral mid: Slate 300 – #CBD5F5

Warm accent: Soft coral – #F97373

Background: Off-white – #F9FAFB

Usage:

Hero background: Off-white or Teal 50 gradient.

Primary CTAs: Teal 600 with white text; hover Teal 700.

Secondary highlights (e.g., “New” badge): Soft coral.

Option B – Gentle Pediatric + Research Feel

Primary: Soft blue – #2563EB

Secondary: Soft mint – #A7F3D0

Accent: Warm peach – #FDBA74

Neutral background: #F5F5F5

Text: Dark gray – #111827

Usage:

Section backgrounds alternate between white and very light gray.

Charts, pills, and icons use mint and peach to keep it friendly.

Limit heavy blue backgrounds to small hero areas or banners; keep most layouts high-contrast on white.

Regardless of palette, enforce:

Consistent CTA color site-wide.

At most 3–4 distinct colors in any one viewport.

WCAG-appropriate contrast for text on colored buttons.

6. Content Strategy to Reinforce the Positioning
You already have a /blog and a /meal-plan generator endpoint. Leverage those as the backbone of acquisition and nurture.

6.1 Core Content Pillars
Organize your content into 4–5 clusters:

ARFID & feeding disorders 101

“ARFID vs picky eating: what parents need to know”

“Signs your child’s eating goes beyond typical picky eating”

“What to expect from feeding therapy (and how apps like EatPal support it)”
​

Food chaining in real life

“What is food chaining? A therapist-backed guide for parents”

“5 real food chains starting from chicken nuggets / mac and cheese / yogurt”

“Common mistakes that stall food chaining progress (and how to avoid them)”

Meal planning & grocery support for selective eaters

“Weekly grocery list for kids with ARFID who only eat beige foods”

“How to build a meal rotation when your child eats fewer than 10 foods”

“Busy-week survival plan: protecting feeding progress when life gets chaotic”

Autism, sensory challenges, and mealtime routines

“Why many autistic kids struggle with eating – and what actually helps”

“Sensory-friendly meal routines that support food chaining”

“Visual supports for mealtimes: charts, timers, and scripts”

Therapist / clinic-specific content

“Standardizing food logs and chains across your feeding team”

“From spreadsheets to structured data: how one clinic scaled feeding therapy with digital tools”
​

“ARFID care coordination: what therapists wish parents tracked between sessions”

Each pillar should internally link to:

The 5-day meal plan generator

Your app signup

Relevant “What is ARFID / What is food chaining” evergreen explainer articles

6.2 Lead Magnets & Tools
Use your existing 5-day meal plan generator as the primary lead magnet, but make it explicit on the homepage and blog:

Gate advanced features (printable plan, grocery list, progress tracking) behind email signup.

Offer additional free resources:

“Safe Food List Template” (PDF) – parents list current safe foods and textures.
​

“Food Chaining Worksheet” with example micro-steps between foods.

“Mealtime Script Cheat Sheet” to reduce pressure language.

6.3 SEO & Distribution
Target mid–high intent keywords tied to your exact niche:

“ARFID meal plan for kids”

“food chaining examples”

“picky eater meal plan app”

“feeding therapy at home tools”

“kids only eats [food]” style long-tails

Use:

Long-form guides (2–3k words) for cornerstone pieces like “Food Chaining 101”.

Short, specific posts that answer common Reddit/FB group questions (“What do I do if my child refuses every new food I offer?”).

Then repurpose:

Each article → 3–5 Instagram carousels or Reels script ideas.

Data visualizations from your anonymized dataset (e.g., “Most common safe foods in ARFID kids”) to build authority, clearly noting privacy protections.

6.4 Email & In-App Education
After signup:

Onboarding sequence (7–10 short emails / in-app messages):

Day 1: “What we mean by food chaining (and what we will never ask you to do).”

Day 2: “How to rate your child’s stress at mealtime – and why it matters.”

Day 3–5: Micro-lessons tied to the 5-day plan.

Day 7: Gentle upsell to paid plan with testimonials.

Ongoing “bite-sized” education:

Weekly “One new chain to try” emails.

Therapist Q&As, case stories (de-identified), common troubleshooting scenarios.

7. Translating This into Concrete Changes on Your Site
Given your tech background, here’s a 4–6 week implementation roadmap:

Week 1–2: Messaging & Structure
Implement the new hero copy, subhead, and dual CTA pattern.

Add the social proof strip and three-pillar value proposition.

Create a “How it works” section with simple graphics or icons.

Add the therapist section + link to therapist pricing/info.

Week 2–3: Pricing & Plans
Clarify and publish simple, opinionated pricing:

One or two parent plans (Monthly + Annual).

One therapist plan with a clear “Contact us for clinic pricing” option.

Make sure pricing page text repeats the core value props (evidence-based, food chaining, therapist-aligned).

Week 3–4: Content & Lead Magnet
Turn the 5-day meal plan generator into a prominent CTA: hero + blog sidebar + footer.

Write and publish at least:

1 cornerstone article (“Food Chaining: The Parent’s Guide”)

2 supporting blog posts from the pillar list.

Design and ship 1–2 downloadable PDFs (Safe Food List, Food Chain Worksheet) and gate them with email.

Week 4–6: Visual Refinement
Decide on a color palette and implement:

Update Tailwind (or your design tokens) to enforce new colors.

Standardize button styles and section backgrounds.

Add 3–4 custom illustrations or icon sets using the new palette (families at the table, food chains, therapist dashboards).

Run lightweight usability tests with 5–10 target parents or therapists (even remotely) to confirm that:

They instantly understand what EatPal does.

The page feels calm, credible, and not overwhelming.

8. Why This Should Specifically Move You Toward $15k MRR
Tightening homepage messaging and brand identity in this way helps in three concrete ways:

Higher conversion on existing traffic

Parents currently landing on your site from web mentions/WebCatalog/etc. may only see generic “AI meal planning” language and bounce.
​

Clearer niche framing (“extreme picky eating / ARFID / food chaining”) increases perceived relevance and trial signups.

Better fit with how clinicians already talk about the problem

You echo ARFID and food-chaining language that therapists trust and use themselves.

That makes partnerships, referrals, and clinic pilots easier.

SEO & content that compound over time

There is substantial search volume around picky eating, ARFID, and food chaining with relatively few deeply productized, app-based solutions.

Consistent publishing + a strong lead magnet gives you compounding organic acquisition over 6–18 months.



PRD Section: 
Below is a PRD-style document based on the principles we just defined. You can copy this into your own docs and iterate.

***

# Product Requirements Document (PRD)  
**Product:** EatPal Website & Messaging Refresh  
**Owner:** [TBD]  
**Last Updated:** [Set Date]

***

## 1. Background & Context

EatPal is an AI-powered meal planning platform built on food chaining science for families dealing with extreme picky eating, ARFID, and related feeding challenges. The product also serves feeding therapists and clinics who need structured tools to extend therapy into the home.

Current challenges:

- Homepage messaging is not maximally clear or conversion-focused for high-anxiety parents.
- The dual audience (parents + therapists) is not clearly handled in the site IA and copy.
- Brand voice and visual design may not fully align with the emotional state of users (stressed parents, clinically-minded therapists).
- Content strategy is not yet fully systematized around high-intent topics like “ARFID meal plans”, “food chaining”, etc.

Target outcome: improve positioning, conversion, and retention so that EatPal can realistically reach **$15k MRR** (via a hybrid B2C/B2B model).

***

## 2. Problem Statement

Parents of children with extreme picky eating or ARFID:

- Struggle to find tools that are designed specifically for feeding disorders (not generic meal apps).
- Feel overwhelmed by complex therapy protocols and under-supported between sessions.
- Don’t know how to translate “food chaining” and evidence-based approaches into daily meals.

Feeding therapists and clinics:

- Use ad-hoc tools (spreadsheets, paper logs) that don’t scale or capture consistent data.
- Need a structured way to coordinate between in-clinic sessions and home implementation.
- Lack a shared platform that standardizes food chains, meal logs, and progress tracking.

The current website does not:

- Clearly and quickly communicate that EatPal is **for them** (extreme picky/ARFID families and feeding professionals).
- Tell a compelling evidence-based story in parent-friendly language.
- Offer a clear, opinionated path to try and adopt the product (free trial, plan structures).
- Present a calm, credible visual identity aligned with the niche.

### 8.7 Email & Onboarding Content (High-Level)

- **Req EM-1:** Design a 7–10 touch onboarding sequence (can be emails and/or in-app messages).
- **Req EM-2:** Sequence must include:
  - Explanation of food chaining and EatPal’s approach.
  - Guidance on using the 5-day plan.
  - Gentle invitation to move from free to paid after first meaningful use.
- **Req EM-3:** Connect email triggers to events:
  - Signup.
  - 5-day plan generated.
  - First log recorded.
  - 3 days of inactivity.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- At least 4 core emails drafted and scheduled for launch.
- Basic behavioral triggers functioning for key events.

## 9. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Accessibility:**  
  - Color contrast meets WCAG AA.  
  - Form fields labeled properly; keyboard navigation works.

- **Performance:**  
  - Core web vitals within acceptable range (LCP < 2.5s on 75th percentile).

- **Privacy/Compliance:**  
  - Clear privacy policy and data handling statements, especially around children’s health data.  
  - Basic compliance language aligned with US users (HIPAA-relevant statements if applicable).

## 10. Dependencies & Risks

### 10.1 Dependencies

- Access to or creation of:
  - Clinically-reviewed copy for ARFID/food chaining explanations.
  - Example food chains and scripts.
- Design resources for:
  - Palette selection and basic illustration/icon work.
- Engineering resources for:
  - Homepage layout changes.
  - CTA flows (5-day plan, email gating).
  - Email automation setup.

### 10.2 Risks

- Overloading parents with information if copy is too long or clinical.
- Underrepresenting therapist value if messaging skews too heavily B2C.
- Slower SEO impact; traffic gains may be delayed beyond immediate conversion improvements.

## 11. Milestones & Timeline (Draft)

**Week 1–2: Discovery & Copy**

- Finalize positioning statement & homepage IA.
- Draft hero, problem/solution, value props, “How it works”, therapist section copy.
- Confirm palette and basic components.

**Week 3–4: Build & Integrate**

- Implement homepage changes, new CTA flows, and pricing updates.
- Hook up 5-day plan generator as main lead magnet.
- Implement core color tokens and basic visual tweaks.

**Week 5–6: Content & Onboarding**

- Publish cornerstone article + 2 supporting posts.
- Set up onboarding email sequence and triggers.
- Light user testing with 5–10 parents and 3–5 therapists; incorporate learnings.

If helpful, the next iteration can be:

- Turning each requirement (HP-1, PR-1, etc.) into GitHub issues / Jira tickets.
- Adding specific copy drafts per section directly into the PRD, so design/engineering can implement without further translation.
