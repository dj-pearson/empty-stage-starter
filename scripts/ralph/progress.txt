## Codebase Patterns
- TypeScript strict mode is enabled in both `tsconfig.json` and `tsconfig.app.json` - all new code must be strict-compliant
- AppContext.tsx uses `RecipeRow` (DB type) and `RecipeInsert` for typed Supabase operations - use `Database['public']['Tables'][tableName]['Row']` pattern for other tables
- Real-time subscription callbacks should use `RealtimePayload<T>` interface defined in AppContext.tsx for type safety
- DB uses snake_case, UI uses camelCase - `normalizeRecipeFromDB()` maps between them
- `npx tsc --noEmit` for typecheck, `npx vitest run` for tests (176 passing), `npm run build` for full build (~3.5 min)
- Explicit `any` types exist in ~82 files (mostly admin/integration code) - these pass `noImplicitAny` but should be replaced with proper types incrementally

## 2026-02-12 - US-001
- Enabled `strict: true` in tsconfig.app.json (was `false`) and tsconfig.json
- Removed redundant `noImplicitAny: true` from tsconfig.app.json (covered by strict)
- Replaced `any` types in AppContext.tsx with proper typed alternatives:
  - `normalizeRecipeFromDB(r: any)` → `normalizeRecipeFromDB(r: RecipeRow)`
  - `dbPayload: any` → `dbPayload: Partial<RecipeInsert>`
  - Removed `(recipeData as any).field` casts in recipe migration code
  - Real-time subscription callbacks: `(payload: any)` → `RealtimePayload<GroceryItem|PlanEntry|Kid>`
  - `dbUpdates: any` → `dbUpdates: Partial<RecipeRow>`
- Added `Database` type import, `RecipeRow`, `RecipeInsert` type aliases, and `RealtimePayload<T>` interface
- Files changed: tsconfig.json, tsconfig.app.json, src/contexts/AppContext.tsx, prd.json
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The codebase was already `noImplicitAny: true` compliant, so enabling strict mode caused zero new errors
  - `strict: true` subsumes `noImplicitAny`, `strictNullChecks`, `strictFunctionTypes`, etc.
  - ~82 files still have explicit `any` types (pass noImplicitAny) - these are mostly in admin/integration components
  - Supabase DB types are at `src/integrations/supabase/types.ts` with `Database['public']['Tables'][name]['Row'|'Insert'|'Update']` pattern

## 2026-02-12 - US-002
- Deleted `src/components/admin/BlogCMSManager-OLD.tsx.bak` and `src/components/admin/EmailMarketingManager-OLD.tsx.bak`
- Removed unused imports across 52 admin component files (already present as unstaged changes)
- Prefixed unused variables with `_` for linter compliance (e.g., `isCollapsed` → `_isCollapsed` in AdminSidebar.tsx)
- Searched for `.bak`, `.backup`, `.old`, `.orig` files - no additional tracked files found
- Files changed: 54 admin component files (52 modified, 2 deleted)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The unused import removals were already present as unstaged working tree changes when this iteration started
  - The `backup/` directory contains DB backup files but is not tracked in git
  - Pre-existing test timing issue in `useScanner.test.ts` causes 1 error after test run but all 176 tests pass
  - ESLint `--quiet` shows many `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` and `@ts-nocheck` errors in admin components - these are pre-existing and out of scope for this story

## 2026-02-12 - US-003
- Created `src/lib/env.ts` with Zod schema validating all VITE_ environment variables
- Required vars: `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` (validated as URL), `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` (non-empty string)
- Optional vars with correct types: `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` (URL or empty), `VITE_SENTRY_ENABLED` (enum "true"/"false" → boolean), `VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, `VITE_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID`, `VITE_FUNCTIONS_URL` (URL or empty)
- Exports typed `Env` type and `getEnv()` accessor
- `validateEnv()` called in `src/main.tsx` before Sentry initialization and app render
- In dev mode, logs clear error messages listing each missing/invalid var
- In production, returns null silently (app already handles missing config via mock Supabase client)
- Files changed: src/lib/env.ts (new), src/main.tsx
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The Supabase client already handles missing env vars gracefully with a mock client pattern - env validation supplements but doesn't replace this
  - `import.meta.env.VITE_*` values are `string | undefined` at runtime - Zod `.optional()` handles the undefined case
  - VITE_SENTRY_DSN and VITE_FUNCTIONS_URL can be empty strings in .env files, so validation must allow both URL and empty string
