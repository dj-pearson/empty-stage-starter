## Part 1: Competitive Landscape Analysis

### Direct Competitors

| Competitor | Domain Authority | Strategy | Weakness We Exploit |
|-----------|------------------|----------|-------------------|
| **Picky Plates** | ~25 | Weekly meal plans via email | No food chaining science, no AI features |
| **Listonic Meal Plans** | ~45 | Generic meal planning | Not picky-eater specialized |
| **Your Kid's Table** | ~40 | OT feeding therapy blog | Primarily content, no app platform |
| **Good Cheap Eats** | ~50 | Budget meal planning | Not focused on selective eating |
| **Nourish** | ~35 | Dietitian marketplace | No self-serve meal planning |

### Key Insights

**1. Nobody owns "food chaining + technology"**
- All food chaining content is educational, not SaaS
- Opportunity to be THE platform that implements food chaining algorithmically

**2. Competitors focus on recipes, not systematic progression**
- They share meal ideas but don't track acceptance patterns
- They don't personalize food recommendations based on child's history

**3. AI features are completely absent**
- No competitor has AI meal suggestions
- No competitor has predictive food acceptance modeling

## Part 4: Dynamic Sitemap Implementation

### Current Issue
Static sitemap doesn't auto-update with new blog posts, limiting discoverability.

### Solution: Dynamic Sitemap Generation

**Implementation (Supabase Edge Function):**

```typescript
// File: /supabase/functions/generate-sitemap/index.ts

import { serve } from "https://deno.land/std@0.168.0/http/server.ts";
import { createClient } from "https://esm.sh/@supabase/supabase-js@2";

serve(async (req) => {
  const supabaseUrl = Deno.env.get("SUPABASE_URL")!;
  const supabaseKey = Deno.env.get("SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY")!;
  const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseKey);

  // Fetch all published blog posts
  const { data: posts } = await supabase
    .from("blog_posts")
    .select("slug, updated_at, created_at")
    .eq("status", "published")
    .order("updated_at", { ascending: false });

  // Static pages
  const staticPages = [
    { loc: "/", priority: "1.0", changefreq: "daily" },
    { loc: "/features", priority: "0.9", changefreq: "weekly" },
    { loc: "/pricing", priority: "0.9", changefreq: "monthly" },
    { loc: "/blog", priority: "0.8", changefreq: "daily" },
    { loc: "/about", priority: "0.7", changefreq: "monthly" },
    { loc: "/contact", priority: "0.6", changefreq: "monthly" },
  ];

  // Build sitemap XML
  const baseUrl = "https://eatpal.com";
  
  let xml = `<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<urlset xmlns="http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9"
        xmlns:news="http://www.google.com/schemas/sitemap-news/0.9"
        xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
        xmlns:image="http://www.google.com/schemas/sitemap-image/1.1"
        xmlns:video="http://www.google.com/schemas/sitemap-video/1.1">
`;

  // Add static pages
  staticPages.forEach((page) => {
    xml += `
  <url>
    <loc>${baseUrl}${page.loc}</loc>
    <changefreq>${page.changefreq}</changefreq>
    <priority>${page.priority}</priority>
    <lastmod>${new Date().toISOString()}</lastmod>
  </url>`;
  });

  // Add blog posts
  posts?.forEach((post) => {
    xml += `
  <url>
    <loc>${baseUrl}/blog/${post.slug}</loc>
    <changefreq>monthly</changefreq>
    <priority>0.7</priority>
    <lastmod>${new Date(post.updated_at).toISOString()}</lastmod>
  </url>`;
  });

  xml += "\n</urlset>";

  return new Response(xml, {
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/xml; charset=utf-8",
      "Cache-Control": "public, max-age=3600", // Cache for 1 hour
    },
  });
});
```

**Auto-Update Schedule:**
- Triggered on blog post publish/update (webhook)
- Fallback: Cron job every hour
- Submitted to Google Search Console automatically

**URL Structure:**
- Homepage: `/sitemap.xml` (main sitemap)
- Blog sitemap: `/sitemap-blog.xml` (blog posts only)
- Static pages: `/sitemap-pages.xml` (static pages)

        Food chaining is an evidence-based feeding therapy technique that 
        introduces new foods by building "chains" from foods a child already 
        accepts. Instead of forcing completely new foods, we make gradual 
        changes in taste, texture, or appearance.
