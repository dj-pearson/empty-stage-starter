# Initial Concept

Munch Maker Mate (also referred to as EatPal) is a comprehensive full-stack meal planning and nutrition tracking application designed for families. It features a web client (React, Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn-ui), a cross-platform mobile client (React Native, Expo), and a Supabase backend (PostgreSQL, Authentication, Edge Functions). The application leverages 3D features using `@react-three/fiber` and `@react-three/drei` for an enhanced user experience, and integrates with external APIs like Open Food Facts, USDA FoodData Central, and FoodRepo for comprehensive food data. Key mobile features include camera-based barcode scanning for easy food item addition and multi-API lookups for nutrition data.

## Primary Goals
