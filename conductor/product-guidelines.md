# Product Guidelines

## Tone and Voice

The application's user-facing text and communications should adopt a **Friendly and Encouraging** tone. This means being warm, supportive, and motivating to help users, especially families, achieve their meal planning and nutrition tracking goals. The language should be positive, empathetic, and build confidence in users as they navigate their health and dietary journeys.
