Verification Report for Phase: Multi-Database Integration Logic

Automated Test Command: npm run test

Manual Verification Steps:
1.  **Start the development server with the command:** `npm run dev`
2.  **Open your browser to the URL of your application.**
3.  **Simulate Barcode Scan:** You will need to manually trigger the `handleScan` function in the `useScanner` hook (e.g., via a test button or by directly calling it from the console if the hook is exposed) with a sample barcode, which will then trigger the `queryDatabases` function.
    *   **Sample Barcode 1 (should prioritize local):** `12345` (assuming local DB has a food for this)
    *   **Sample Barcode 2 (should prioritize Open Food Facts):** `67890` (assuming Open Food Facts has a food for this, but local doesn't)
    *   **Sample Barcode 3 (should prioritize USDA):** `11111` (assuming USDA has a food for this, but local and OFO don't)
    *   **Sample Barcode 4 (should prioritize FoodRepo):** `22222` (assuming FoodRepo has a food for this, but local, OFO, and USDA don't)
4.  **Observe Harmonized Data Display:** Confirm that the `HarmonizedFoodDisplay` component (wherever it is integrated into the UI) correctly displays the harmonized food data for each simulated scan, prioritizing data sources as expected.
    *   For example, for a barcode that has local data, the UI should show the local data.
    *   For a barcode with Open Food Facts data, it should show the harmonized data from Open Food Facts.
    *   For a barcode with USDA data, it should show the harmonized data from USDA.
    *   For a barcode with FoodRepo data, it should show the harmonized data from FoodRepo.
    *   Specifically, confirm that the food name, calories, and nutrient list are displayed, and that the "Fiber" nutrient is correctly harmonized.
