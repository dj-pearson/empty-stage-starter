# 🎮 Ballpit-Style Movement Added!

Inspired by [ReactBits Ballpit](https://reactbits.dev/backgrounds/ballpit)

## New Animation Types

### 1. **Drift Animation** 🍎🍌🥬
- Moves **horizontally + vertically**
- Adds **rotation** while moving
- Creates organic, floating feeling
- Used by: Apple, Banana, Lettuce

**Movement pattern:**
```
Start → Drift right & up (rotate 5°) 
      → Drift left & up more (rotate -3°)
      → Drift left & up (rotate 7°)
      → Back to start
```

### 2. **Wiggle Animation** 🥦🍓🍅
- **Side-to-side** movement
- **Up and down** simultaneously
- **Playful rotation**
- More energetic feel
- Used by: Broccoli, Strawberry, Tomato

**Movement pattern:**
```
Start → Wiggle left & up (rotate -5°)
      → Wiggle right & up more (rotate 5°)
      → Wiggle left & up (rotate -3°)
      → Back to start
```

### 3. **Orbital Animation** 🥕🍊
- **Circular motion**
- Constant rotation
- Smooth, continuous path
- Hypnotic effect
- Used by: Carrot, Orange

**Movement pattern:**
```
Moves in a perfect circle while staying upright
(20px radius orbit)
```

## Variety = Natural Look

Each food item now has its own **unique movement style**:
- 🍎 Apple: Drifts gently (6s)
- 🥦 Broccoli: Wiggles playfully (5s)
- 🥕 Carrot: Orbits slowly (8s)
- 🍌 Banana: Drifts lazily (7s)
- 🍓 Strawberry: Wiggles quickly (4.5s)
- 🍊 Orange: Orbits very slowly (9s)
- 🥬 Lettuce: Drifts medium (6.5s)
- 🍅 Tomato: Wiggles moderately (5.5s)

## Key Features

✅ **3 different animation types** (drift, wiggle, orbit)  
✅ **8 different timing variations** (4.5s to 9s)  
✅ **Staggered start times** (0s to 3.5s delays)  
✅ **Varied speeds** for natural randomness  
✅ **Rotation included** for more dynamic feel  
✅ **Horizontal + vertical** movement  
✅ **Pure CSS** - no JavaScript overhead  

## Comparison to Ballpit

**[ReactBits Ballpit](https://reactbits.dev/backgrounds/ballpit):**
- Physics-based falling
- Interactive (responds to mouse)
- Bouncing balls
- High energy

**Your Food Emojis:**
- Organic floating motion
- Non-interactive (atmospheric)
- Food items (on-brand)
- Calm, professional energy
- Multiple movement styles

## Visual Effect

The varied movements create a **living, breathing background** where:
- Some items **drift** lazily across the screen
- Others **wiggle** playfully in place
- A few **orbit** in smooth circles
- All at **different speeds**
- Creating **natural randomness**

Much more **dynamic and engaging** than simple up/down motion!
